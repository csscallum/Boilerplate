<h1>CSSCallum&#39;s New Site Boilerplate</h1>
<p>Not quite a framework but more than a boilerplate, this is my personal new site template which aims to give you a jumpstart on a new project. All the things you do on each site such as adding Google Analytics code, normalize building a Sass file structure is all done.</p>
<h2>index.html</h2>
<h2>Sass File Structure</h2>
<h2>Sass Mixins/Helpers</h2>
<h2>Grid Structure</h2>
<h2>JavaScript</h2>
